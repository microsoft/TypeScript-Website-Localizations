[With TypeScript 3.7](/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#--declaration-and---allowjs),
TypeScript added support for generating .d.ts files from JavaScript using JSDoc syntax.

This set up means you can own the editor experience of TypeScript-powered editors without porting your project to TypeScript, or having to maintain .d.ts files in your codebase.
TypeScript supports most JSDoc tags, you can find [the reference here](/docs/handbook/type-checking-javascript-files.html#supported-jsdoc).

## Setting up your Project to emit .d.ts files

To add creation of .d.ts files in your project, you will need to do up-to four steps:

- Add TypeScript to your dev dependencies
- Add a `tsconfig.json` to configure TypeScript
- Run the TypeScript compiler to generate the corresponding d.ts files for JS files
- (optional) Edit your package.json to reference the types

### Adding TypeScript

You can learn how to do this in our [installation page](/download).

### TSConfig

The TSConfig is a jsonc file which configures both your compiler flags, and declare where to find files.
In this case, you will want a file like the following:

```jsonc tsconfig
{
  // Change this to match your project
  "include": ["src/**/*"],

  "compilerOptions": {
    // Tells TypeScript to read JS files, as
    // normally they are ignored as source files
    "allowJs": true,
    // Generate d.ts files
    "declaration": true,
    // This compiler run should
    // only output d.ts files
    "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
    // Types should go into this directory.
    // Removing this would place the .d.ts files
    // next to the .js files
    "outDir": "dist"
  }
}
```

You can learn more about the options in the [tsconfig reference](/tsconfig).
An alternative to using a TSConfig file is the CLI, this is the same behavior as a CLI command.

```sh
npx -p typescript tsc src/**/*.js --declaration --allowJs --emitDeclarationOnly --outDir types
```

## Run the compiler

You can learn how to do this in our [installation page](/download).
You want to make sure these files are included in your package if you have the files in your project's `.gitignore`.

## Editing the package.json

TypeScript replicates the node resolution for modules in a `package.json`, with an additional step for finding .d.ts files.
Roughly, the resolution will first check the optional `"types"` field, then the `"main"` field, and finally will try `index.d.ts` in the root.

| Package.json              | Location of default .d.ts      |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| No "types" field          | checks "main", then index.d.ts |
| "types": "main.d.ts"      | main.d.ts                      |
| "types": "./dist/main.js" | ./dist/main.d.ts               |

If absent, then "main" is used

| Package.json             | Location of default .d.ts |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------ |
| No "main" field          | index.d.ts                |
| "main":"index.js"        | index.d.ts                |
| "main":"./dist/index.js" | ./dist/index.d.ts         |

## Tips

If you'd like to write tests for your .d.ts files, try [tsd](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd).
