## Comparing JavaScript to an example DTS

## Common CommonJS Patterns

A module using CommonJS patterns uses `module.exports` to describe the exported values. For example, here is a module which exports a function and a numerical constant:

```js
const maxInterval = 12;

function getArrayLength(arr) {
  return arr.length;
}

module.exports = {
  getArrayLength,
  maxInterval,
};
```

This can be described by the following `.d.ts`:

```ts
export function getArrayLength(arr: any[]): number;
export const maxInterval: 12;
```

The TypeScript playground can show you the `.d.ts` equivalent for JavaScript code. You can [try it yourself here](/play?useJavaScript=true#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAcwKZQIICcsEMCeAMqmMlABYAUuOAlIgN6IBQiiW6IWSNWAdABsSZcswC+zCAgDOURAFtcADwAq5GKUQBeRAEYATM2by4AExBC+qJQAc4WKNO2NWKdNjxFhFADSvFquqk4sxAA).

The `.d.ts` syntax intentionally looks like [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) syntax.
ES Modules was ratified by TC39 in 2019, while it has been available via transpilers for a long time, however if you have a JavaScript codebase using ES Modules:

```js
export function getArrayLength(arr) {
  return arr.length;
}
```

This would have the following `.d.ts` equivalent:

```ts
export function getArrayLength(arr: any[]): number;
```

### Default Exports

In CommonJS you can export any value as the default export, for example here is a regular expression module:

```js
module.exports = /hello( world)?/;
```

Which can be described by the following .d.ts:

```ts
declare const helloWorld: RegExp;
export default helloWorld;
```

Or a number:

```js
module.exports = 3.142;
```

```ts
declare const pi: number;
export default pi;
```

One style of exporting in CommonJS is to export a function.
Because a function is also an object, then extra fields can be added and are included in the export.

```js
function getArrayLength(arr) {
  return arr.length;
}
getArrayLength.maxInterval = 12;

module.exports = getArrayLength;
```

Which can be described with:

```ts
export default function getArrayLength(arr: any[]): number;
export const maxInterval: 12;
```

Note that using `export default` in your .d.ts files requires [`esModuleInterop: true`](/tsconfig#esModuleInterop) to work.
If you can't have `esModuleInterop: true` in your project, such as when you're submitting a PR to Definitely Typed, you'll have to use the `export=` syntax instead. This older syntax is harder to use but works everywhere.
Here's how the above example would have to be written using `export=`:

```ts
declare function getArrayLength(arr: any[]): number;
declare namespace getArrayLength {
  declare const maxInterval: 12;
}

export = getArrayLength;
```

See [Module: Functions](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-function-d-ts.html) for details of how that works, and the [Modules reference](/docs/handbook/modules.html) page.

## Handling Many Consuming Import

There are many ways to import a module in modern consuming code:

```ts
const fastify = require("fastify");
const { fastify } = require("fastify");
import fastify = require("fastify");
import * as Fastify from "fastify";
import { fastify, FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import fastify from "fastify";
import fastify, { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
```

Covering all of these cases requires the JavaScript code to actually support all of these patterns.
To support many of these patterns, a CommonJS module would need to look something like:

```js
class FastifyInstance {}

function fastify() {
  return new FastifyInstance();
}

fastify.FastifyInstance = FastifyInstance;

// Allows for { fastify }
fastify.fastify = fastify;
// Allows for strict ES Module support
fastify.default = fastify;
// Sets the default export
module.exports = fastify;
```

## Types in Modules

You may want to provide a type for JavaScript code which does not exist

```js
function getArrayMetadata(arr) {
  return {
    length: getArrayLength(arr),
    firstObject: arr[0],
  };
}

module.exports = {
  getArrayMetadata,
};
```

This can be described with:

```ts
export type ArrayMetadata = {
  length: number;
  firstObject: any | undefined;
};
export function getArrayMetadata(arr: any[]): ArrayMetadata;
```

This example is a good case for [using generics](/docs/handbook/generics.html#generic-types) to provide richer type information:

```ts
export type ArrayMetadata<ArrType> = {
  length: number;
  firstObject: ArrType | undefined;
};

export function getArrayMetadata<ArrType>(
  arr: ArrType[]
): ArrayMetadata<ArrType>;
```

Now the type of the array propagates into the `ArrayMetadata` type.

The types which are exported can then be re-used by consumers of the modules using either `import` or `import type` in TypeScript code or [JSDoc imports](/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#import-types).

### Namespaces in Module Code

Trying to describe the runtime relationship of JavaScript code can be tricky.
When the ES Module-like syntax doesn't provide enough tools to describe the exports then you can use `namespaces`.

For example, you may have complex enough types to describe that you choose to namespace them inside your `.d.ts`:

```ts
// This represents the JavaScript class which would be available at runtime
export class API {
  constructor(baseURL: string);
  getInfo(opts: API.InfoRequest): API.InfoResponse;
}

// This namespace is merged with the API class and allows for consumers, and this file
// to have types which are nested away in their own sections.
declare namespace API {
  export interface InfoRequest {
    id: string;
  }

  export interface InfoResponse {
    width: number;
    height: number;
  }
}
```

To understand how namespaces work in `.d.ts` files read the [`.d.ts` deep dive](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/deep-dive.html).

### Optional Global Usage

You can use `export as namespace` to declare that your module will be available in the global scope in UMD contexts:

```ts
export as namespace moduleName;
```

## Reference Example

To give you an idea of how all these pieces can come together, here is a reference `.d.ts` to start with when making a new module

```ts
// Type definitions for [~THE LIBRARY NAME~] [~OPTIONAL VERSION NUMBER~]
// Project: [~THE PROJECT NAME~]
// Definitions by: [~YOUR NAME~] <[~A URL FOR YOU~]>

/*~ This is the module template file. You should rename it to index.d.ts
 *~ and place it in a folder with the same name as the module.
 *~ For example, if you were writing a file for "super-greeter", this
 *~ file should be 'super-greeter/index.d.ts'
 */

/*~ If this module is a UMD module that exposes a global variable 'myLib' when
 *~ loaded outside a module loader environment, declare that global here.
 *~ Otherwise, delete this declaration.
 */
export as namespace myLib;

/*~ If this module exports functions, declare them like so.
 */
export function myFunction(a: string): string;
export function myOtherFunction(a: number): number;

/*~ You can declare types that are available via importing the module */
export interface SomeType {
  name: string;
  length: number;
  extras?: string[];
}

/*~ You can declare properties of the module using const, let, or var */
export const myField: number;
```

### Library file layout

The layout of your declaration files should mirror the layout of the library.

A library can consist of multiple modules, such as

```
myLib
  +---- index.js
  +---- foo.js
  +---- bar
         +---- index.js
         +---- baz.js
```

These could be imported as

```js
var a = require("myLib");
var b = require("myLib/foo");
var c = require("myLib/bar");
var d = require("myLib/bar/baz");
```

Your declaration files should thus be

```
@types/myLib
  +---- index.d.ts
  +---- foo.d.ts
  +---- bar
         +---- index.d.ts
         +---- baz.d.ts
```

### Testing your types

If you are planning on submitting these changes to DefinitelyTyped for everyone to also use, then we recommend you:

> 1. Create a new folder in `node_modules/@types/[libname]`
> 2. Create an `index.d.ts` in that folder, and copy the example in
> 3. See where your usage of the module breaks, and start to fill out the index.d.ts
> 4. When you're happy, clone [DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped) and follow the instructions in the README. 

Otherwise

> 1. Create a new file in the root of your source tree: `[libname].d.ts`
> 2. Add `declare module "[libname]" {  }`
> 3. Add the template inside the braces of the declare module, and see where your usage breaks
