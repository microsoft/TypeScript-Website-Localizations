For example, when you want to work with JavaScript code which looks like:

```ts
import greeter from "super-greeter";

greeter(2);
greeter("Hello world");
```

To handle both importing via UMD and modules:

```ts
// Type definitions for [~THE LIBRARY NAME~] [~OPTIONAL VERSION NUMBER~]
// Project: [~THE PROJECT NAME~]
// Definitions by: [~YOUR NAME~] <[~A URL FOR YOU~]>

/*~ This is the module template file for function modules.
 *~ You should rename it to index.d.ts and place it in a folder with the same name as the module.
 *~ For example, if you were writing a file for "super-greeter", this
 *~ file should be 'super-greeter/index.d.ts'
 */

// Note that ES6 modules cannot directly export class objects.
// This file should be imported using the CommonJS-style:
//   import x = require('[~THE MODULE~]');
//
// Alternatively, if --allowSyntheticDefaultImports or
// --esModuleInterop is turned on, this file can also be
// imported as a default import:
//   import x from '[~THE MODULE~]';
//
// Refer to the TypeScript documentation at
// https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#export--and-import--require
// to understand common workarounds for this limitation of ES6 modules.

/*~ If this module is a UMD module that exposes a global variable 'myFuncLib' when
 *~ loaded outside a module loader environment, declare that global here.
 *~ Otherwise, delete this declaration.
 */
export as namespace myFuncLib;

/*~ This declaration specifies that the function
 *~ is the exported object from the file
 */
export = Greeter;

/*~ This example shows how to have multiple overloads for your function */
declare function Greeter(name: string): Greeter.NamedReturnType;
declare function Greeter(length: number): Greeter.LengthReturnType;

/*~ If you want to expose types from your module as well, you can
 *~ place them in this block. Often you will want to describe the
 *~ shape of the return type of the function; that type should
 *~ be declared in here, as this example shows.
 *~
 *~ Note that if you decide to include this namespace, the module can be
 *~ incorrectly imported as a namespace object, unless
 *~ --esModuleInterop is turned on:
 *~   import * as x from '[~THE MODULE~]'; // WRONG! DO NOT DO THIS!
 */
declare namespace Greeter {
  export interface LengthReturnType {
    width: number;
    height: number;
  }
  export interface NamedReturnType {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  }

  /*~ If the module also has properties, declare them here. For example,
   *~ this declaration says that this code is legal:
   *~   import f = require('super-greeter');
   *~   console.log(f.defaultName);
   */
  export const defaultName: string;
  export let defaultLength: number;
}
