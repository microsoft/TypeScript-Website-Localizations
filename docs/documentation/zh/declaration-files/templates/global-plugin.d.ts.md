## _UMD_

A _UMD_ module is one that can _either_ be used as module (through an import), or as a global (when run in an environment without a module loader).
Many popular libraries, such as [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), are written this way.
For example, in Node.js or using RequireJS, you would write:

```ts
import moment = require("moment");
console.log(moment.format());
```

whereas in a vanilla browser environment you would write:

```js
console.log(moment.format());
```

### Identifying a UMD library

[UMD modules](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) check for the existence of a module loader environment.
This is an easy-to-spot pattern that looks something like this:

```js
(function (root, factory) {
    if (typeof define === "function" && define.amd) {
        define(["libName"], factory);
    } else if (typeof module === "object" && module.exports) {
        module.exports = factory(require("libName"));
    } else {
        root.returnExports = factory(root.libName);
    }
}(this, function (b) {
```

If you see tests for `typeof define`, `typeof window`, or `typeof module` in the code of a library, especially at the top of the file, it's almost always a UMD library.

Documentation for UMD libraries will also often demonstrate a "Using in Node.js" example showing `require`,
and a "Using in the browser" example showing using a `<script>` tag to load the script.

### Examples of UMD libraries

Most popular libraries are now available as UMD packages.
Examples include [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), and many more.

### Template

There are three templates available for modules,
[`module.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-d-ts.html), [`module-class.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-class-d-ts.html) and [`module-function.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-function-d-ts.html).

Use [`module-function.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-function-d-ts.html) if your module can be _called_ like a function:

```js
var x = require("foo");
// Note: calling 'x' as a function
var y = x(42);
```

Be sure to read the [footnote "The Impact of ES6 on Module Call Signatures"](#the-impact-of-es6-on-module-plugins)

Use [`module-class.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-class-d-ts.html) if your module can be _constructed_ using `new`:

```js
var x = require("bar");
// Note: using 'new' operator on the imported variable
var y = new x("hello");
```

The same [footnote](#the-impact-of-es6-on-module-plugins) applies to these modules.

If your module is not callable or constructable, use the [`module.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-d-ts.html) file.

## _Module Plugin_ or _UMD Plugin_

A _module plugin_ changes the shape of another module (either UMD or module).
For example, in Moment.js, `moment-range` adds a new `range` method to the `moment` object.

For the purposes of writing a declaration file, you'll write the same code whether the module being changed is a plain module or UMD module.

### Template

Use the [`module-plugin.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-plugin-d-ts.html) template.

## _Global Plugin_

A _global plugin_ is global code that changes the shape of some global.
As with _global-modifying modules_, these raise the possibility of runtime conflict.

For example, some libraries add new functions to `Array.prototype` or `String.prototype`.

### Identifying global plugins

Global plugins are generally easy to identify from their documentation.

You'll see examples that look like this:

```js
var x = "hello, world";
// Creates new methods on built-in types
console.log(x.startsWithHello());

var y = [1, 2, 3];
// Creates new methods on built-in types
console.log(y.reverseAndSort());
```

### Template

Use the [`global-plugin.d.ts`](/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/global-plugin-d-ts.html) template.

## _Global-modifying Modules_

A _global-modifying module_ alters existing values in the global scope when they are imported.
For example, there might exist a library which adds new members to `String.prototype` when imported.
This pattern is somewhat dangerous due to the possibility of runtime conflicts,
but we can still write a declaration file for it.

### Identifying global-modifying modules

Global-modifying modules are generally easy to identify from their documentation.
In general, they're similar to global plugins, but need a `require` call to activate their effects.

You might see documentation like this:

```js
// 'require' call that doesn't use its return value
var unused = require("magic-string-time");
/* or */
require("magic-string-time");

var x = "hello, world";
// Creates new methods on built-in types
console.log(x.startsWithHello());

var y = [1, 2, 3];
// Creates new methods on built-in types
console.log(y.reverseAndSort());
```

### Template

Use the [`global-modifying-module.d.ts`](./templates/global-modifying-module.d.ts.md) template.

## Consuming Dependencies

There are several kinds of dependencies your library might have.
This section shows how to import them into the declaration file.

## Dependencies on Global Libraries

If your library depends on a global library, use a `/// <reference types="..." />` directive:

```ts
/// <reference types="someLib" />

function getThing(): someLib.thing;
```

## Dependencies on Modules

If your library depends on a module, use an `import` statement:

```ts
import * as moment from "moment";

function getThing(): moment;
```

## Dependencies on UMD libraries

### From a Global Library

If your global library depends on a UMD module, use a `/// <reference types` directive:

```ts
/// <reference types="moment" />

function getThing(): moment;
```

### From a Module or UMD Library

If your module or UMD library depends on a UMD library, use an `import` statement:

```ts
import * as someLib from "someLib";
```

Do _not_ use a `/// <reference` directive to declare a dependency to a UMD library!

## Footnotes

## Preventing Name Conflicts

Note that it's possible to define many types in the global scope when writing a global declaration file.
We strongly discourage this as it leads to possible unresolvable name conflicts when many declaration files are in a project.

A simple rule to follow is to only declare types _namespaced_ by whatever global variable the library defines.
For example, if the library defines the global value 'cats', you should write

```ts
declare namespace cats {
  interface KittySettings {}
}
```

But _not_

```ts
// at top-level
interface CatsKittySettings {}
```

This guidance also ensures that the library can be transitioned to UMD without breaking declaration file users.

## The Impact of ES6 on Module Plugins

Some plugins add or modify top-level exports on existing modules.
While this is legal in CommonJS and other loaders, ES6 modules are considered immutable and this pattern will not be possible.
Because TypeScript is loader-agnostic, there is no compile-time enforcement of this policy, but developers intending to transition to an ES6 module loader should be aware of this.

## The Impact of ES6 on Module Call Signatures

Many popular libraries, such as Express, expose themselves as a callable function when imported.
For example, the typical Express usage looks like this:

```ts
import exp = require("express");
var app = exp();
```

In ES6 module loaders, the top-level object (here imported as `exp`) can only have properties;
the top-level module object is _never_ callable.
The most common solution here is to define a `default` export for a callable/constructable object;
some module loader shims will automatically detect this situation and replace the top-level object with the `default` export.

## Library file layout

The layout of your declaration files should mirror the layout of the library.

A library can consist of multiple modules, such as

```
myLib
  +---- index.js
  +---- foo.js
  +---- bar
         +---- index.js
         +---- baz.js
```

These could be imported as

```js
var a = require("myLib");
var b = require("myLib/foo");
var c = require("myLib/bar");
var d = require("myLib/bar/baz");
```

Your declaration files should thus be

```
@types/myLib
  +---- index.d.ts
  +---- foo.d.ts
  +---- bar
         +---- index.d.ts
         +---- baz.d.ts
```

```ts
// Type definitions for [~THE LIBRARY NAME~] [~OPTIONAL VERSION NUMBER~]
// Project: [~THE PROJECT NAME~]
// Definitions by: [~YOUR NAME~] <[~A URL FOR YOU~]>

/*~ This template shows how to write a global plugin. */

/*~ Write a declaration for the original type and add new members.
 *~ For example, this adds a 'toBinaryString' method with overloads to
 *~ the built-in number type.
 */
interface Number {
  toBinaryString(opts?: MyLibrary.BinaryFormatOptions): string;

  toBinaryString(
    callback: MyLibrary.BinaryFormatCallback,
    opts?: MyLibrary.BinaryFormatOptions
  ): string;
}

/*~ If you need to declare several types, place them inside a namespace
 *~ to avoid adding too many things to the global namespace.
 */
declare namespace MyLibrary {
  type BinaryFormatCallback = (n: number) => string;
  interface BinaryFormatOptions {
    prefix?: string;
    padding: number;
  }
}
```
